# LED Proximity Demo Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the LED Proximity Demonstration system implemented using OpenBSW framework.

## Overview

The LED proximity demo uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to control a WS2812B LED strip (144 LEDs) based on proximity. Objects get closer ‚Üí more LEDs light up. The system demonstrates real-time embedded development with automotive-grade safety considerations.

Just for fun I have put the assumption that the LED strip is pasrt of a driver monitoring system and check how good coPilot is to generate an initial safety argumentation.
