# LED Proximity Demo

This directory contains the LED Proximity demonstration project showcasing OpenBSW framework capabilities.

## LED Proximity Demo
**Location**: [LED_DEMO/](LED_DEMO/)

A comprehensive proximity-based LED demonstration system using:
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement
- WS2812B LED strip (144 LEDs) for visual feedback  
- Cross-platform support (S32K148EVB, RP2040)
- Automotive-grade safety considerations (ASIL B)
- Real-time FreeRTOS integration

**Quick Access**: [LED_DEMO/README.md](LED_DEMO/README.md)
