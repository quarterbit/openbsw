# AUTOSAR Integration

As an add-on to OpenBSW, we provide the models to make it **AUTOSAR ICC1 compliant**.

## Why Should This Interest You?

**OpenBSW allows you to reuse AUTOSAR SWCs and dive into modern MCU development without going greenfield.**

### Key Benefits

- **ðŸ”„ Reuse Existing Assets:** Keep your AUTOSAR Software Components (SWCs) while modernizing the underlying stack
- **ðŸš€ Modern Development:** Code-first approach with textual models instead of complex GUI tools
- **âš¡ Faster Iterations:** No tooling bottleneck - use VS Code, Git, and standard CI/CD pipelines
- **ðŸŽ¯ Best of Both Worlds:** AUTOSAR compatibility on top with flexible C++ basic software below

## The AUTOSAR Challenge

### A Complex Standard
The AUTOSAR standard contains a very large number of features with significant complexity:
- **Redundant Features:** The same functionality can be achieved in different ways, making maintenance difficult
- **Rigid Specification:** The entire software stack is specified in detail, making extension challenging  
- **Model-Heavy Approach:** Heavily based on modeling and code generation, creating usability barriers

### Consequences of Complexity
- **High Learning Curve:** Every developer needs at least basic AUTOSAR knowledge
- **Implementation Challenges:** Tool vendors struggle to keep up with feature evolution
- **Development Bottlenecks:** Most tools don't support modern CI/CD practices, leading to long update cycles

### The Tooling Bottleneck
- **Limited Access:** Model changes require specialized tools not available to all developers
- **Advanced Skills Required:** Complex tooling demands significant expertise
- **Version Control Issues:** Models can't be easily merged with standard VCS tools
- **Slow Change Cycles:** Every modification requires a tooling detour

## The ESR AUTOSAR Stack Approach

### Smart Simplification
- **Essential Feature Subset:** Implements features sufficient for all typical automotive projects
- **ICC1 Compliance:** 100% AUTOSAR compatible at the application interface layer
- **Modern Foundation:** Flexible and open C++ stack below the AUTOSAR interface

### Code-First Philosophy
- **Configuration as Code:** Part of configuration expressed directly in code
- **Sensible Defaults:** Remaining configuration simplified through intelligent defaults
- **Textual Models:** Models treated like code for better tooling integration
