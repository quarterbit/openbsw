# Community

OpenBSW is built with an **open-source mindset**, reflecting our belief that the automotive industry should collaborate on non-differentiating software platforms. By building a vibrant community of developers and companies, we aim to enable innovation and collaboration that will drive the entire industry forward.

## Our Open Source Philosophy

**Why Open Source for Automotive?**
- **Attract broader talent pool** from the wider software development community
- **Tap into the larger ecosystem** of programming languages, libraries, and tools
- **Create a more pleasant and efficient developer experience**
- **Enable developers to explore new ideas and innovate more freely**
