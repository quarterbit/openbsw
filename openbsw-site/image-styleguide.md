# OpenBSW Image & Icon Style Guide

## Common Theme for Images & Icons

- **Format:** Use SVG for icons and transparent PNG for images/illustrations. All images should have transparent backgrounds to allow placement on both white and dark backgrounds.
- **Color Palette:** Use the OpenBSW/Eclipse SDV purple as the primary accent, with supporting colors in grayscale, white, and subtle blue or orange highlights for contrast.
- **Style:** Flat, modern, and minimalistic. Avoid excessive gradients or shadows. Use simple, bold lines and geometric shapes.
- **Consistency:** All icons should have a uniform stroke width and visual weight. Use a consistent corner radius for rounded elements.
- **Size:** Design icons for clarity at 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 px. Larger illustrations should scale cleanly.
- **Imagery:** Prefer schematic, vector-style illustrations over photorealistic images. Use simple overlays or outlines to indicate modularity, integration, or connectivity.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast and clear shapes for visibility in both light and dark modes.
