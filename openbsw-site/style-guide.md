# Design & Style Guide

This guide defines the visual and content style for OpenBSW materials.

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette:** Use modern, high-contrast colors (e.g., blue, orange, white, black)
- **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif fonts for clarity and professionalism
- **Imagery:** Prefer vector-style diagrams, clear architecture illustrations, and real-world automotive context
- **Icons:** Use simple, recognizable icons for features and navigation

## Content Principles
- Clear, concise, and technical language
- Focus on benefits for developers and integrators
- Highlight modularity, openness, and reliability

## Image Material
- Diagrams should be SVG or PNG, with transparent backgrounds
- Use consistent color coding for layers/modules
- Prefer schematic over photorealistic images

This guide will evolve as the project grows.
